  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated: 11 June 2025</em></p>

  <p>Credo (‚Äúwe‚Äù, ‚Äúus‚Äù, or ‚Äúour‚Äù) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information when you use our Credo browser extension (the ‚ÄúExtension‚Äù).</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <h3>a. Browsing Data</h3>
  <p>The Extension may collect limited browsing history data related to your purchases (e.g., product pages and order confirmations) to help you track your shopping activity. We do not collect or store general browsing data outside of purchase-related events.</p>

  <h3>b. Gmail Data</h3>
  <p>If you opt in, the Extension can access your Gmail account to identify purchase receipts and associated product information (such as product names, order IDs, and purchase dates). This access is limited to read-only and specifically targeted at purchase-related emails.</p>

  <h3>c. Google Account Information</h3>
  <p>We use your Google Account (name and email) to identify you and link your shopping activity within the Extension.</p>

  <h3>d. Local Storage</h3>
  <p>We store your data locally in your browser (using <code>chrome.storage.local</code>). This data includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Purchase scenarios (e.g., identified purchase URLs, order IDs)</li>
    <li>Products you have confirmed as purchased or not purchased</li>
    <li>Voting or reaction data on products</li>
    <li>Your basic profile information (name and email)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We use the data described above to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide you with a dashboard of your purchase activity</li>
    <li>Offer insights and comparisons based on your purchases</li>
    <li>Help you classify your purchases (e.g., mark as purchased, not purchased, or reviewed)</li>
    <li>Improve your experience and provide features you‚Äôve opted in for</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We <strong>do not</strong>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sell your data to advertisers or third parties</li>
    <li>Use your data for paid placements or sponsored content</li>
    <li>Track your browsing activity outside of purchase-related events</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
  <p>We do not sell your data. We only share your information with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Our backend servers (hosted by Amazon Web Services) to enable features like product classification and enrichment</li>
    <li>Google‚Äôs APIs (for authentication and Gmail access, with your consent)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We may disclose your information if required by law (e.g., to comply with a valid legal process).</p>

  <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your data, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Using secure Google OAuth authentication</li>
    <li>Storing data locally in your browser, not in external databases (except for minimal data like product classifications and your user ID, stored in our secure backend)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Your Choices and Controls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can choose to enable or disable Gmail data access at any time.</li>
    <li>You can remove stored data at any time using your browser‚Äôs extension data settings or by uninstalling the Extension.</li>
    <li>You can log out to remove your Google Account information from the Extension.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Changes to this Policy</h2>
